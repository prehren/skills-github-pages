title: "Most Cited Authors on the WoS: There's an App For That!"

I've made a Shiny app that allows people to puruse the WoS citation data [I recently used](https://prehren.github.io/something-of-crunch/2024/11/13/top-wos-authors.html) to rank the most cited authors in philosophy journals since 1975 at their own leasure. Here it is (if the app does not show up below, you can also find it on [shinyapps.io](https://prehren.shinyapps.io/most-cited-philosophers-wos/)):

<iframe src="https://prehren.shinyapps.io/most-cited-philosophers-wos/" title="Figure 1. Development over time of the top 25." style="border:none; margin:0 auto; display: block; width:100%; height:1180px; padding-bottom:1em; overflow:hidden;" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<br>

Brief explanation: The top panel shows the overall ranking; the bottom panel shows the ranking's development over time. _k_ is the number of authors included in the overall ranking.
